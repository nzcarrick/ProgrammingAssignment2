## this file contains funtions to allow the caching 
## of inverase matrix functions

## This function creates a cache of a matrix to improve soeed.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## this function calulates the inverse of a matrix uwsing
## using the cache as a source of the matrix

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
